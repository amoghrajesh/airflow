Default installation location of webserver_config.py has been moved to ``$AIRFLOW_HOME/config``

The location of webserver_config.py is hardcoded. This does not allow configuration 
of that path through the config file. While fixing this, the default location 
of the webserver_config.py file has been moved to ``$AIRFLOW_HOME/config`` instead of ``$AIRFLOW_HOME``.
